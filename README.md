# AppleScript utility handlers

A small library of utility handlers, or functions, for use in modern AppleScript. This library is tested in recent versions of MacOS (Ventura).

The goal of this library is to provide an easy drop-in set of handlers that account for multiple cases, and at the very least catch errors in case of an issue. Much of the AppleScript on the internet comes from an outdated source, so it's often untested in the context of new MacOS.

### Roadmap

TODO

This is a work in progress, I'm currently adding my old AppleScript to the `lib.applescript` file and in the process of adjusting them for the new(er) MacOS.

- Add additional handlers
- Sort by category
- Provide usage docs
- Compile and provide binary file
